# Classes #
## Basics ##
* A class may contain its own `constants`, `variables` (called `properties`) and `functions` (called `methods`)
* `$this` is the reference to the calling object and is available inside a method.
* A class can be marked read-only using `readonly` which will add `readonly` modifier to every declared property.
* there is a nullsafe operator now `?->?` to access the property safely.
